    "This notebook provides a step-by-step process to run the HERD prototype on your machine. Because HERD is still in its infancy, this notebook is currently limited in its functionality. This notebook lays the foundation for what HERD will look like as we move towards HERDS first official release, providing examples and information about how HERD is built. "

    "## Step 1: Starting HERD\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional MoE models, HERD instances exist as servers to enable dynamic insertion/deletion of experts and modular use of the Router and Aggregator. To run HERD on your local machine, you need to start up the HERD server using the Python cell located below. Starting up the HERD server will post API entry-points as well as setting up the k8s cluster for experts. For this demo, you can startup the server by simply navigating to the server directory and running `main.py`"
